A C# (CSharp) Console App project. The Fibonacci sequence is an algorithm in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The user is asked to say how many Fibonacci number he wants, and the program then does its stuff.

Open "Fibonacci.sln" to see the code. To run the Console App program directly, launch "Fibonacci.exe" located in "bin/Debug/net7.0". 

Note: german language used.
